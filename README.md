# DayZSA Custom VIP and Admin Loadouts using init.c

Merge file (advanced method): https://github.com/haywardgb/DayZSA_VIP_Loadouts/blob/main/manually_merge.c

OR

1. Rename your existing missions `init.c` to `backup_init.c` 
2. Download the correct (missionName).init.c to your mission folder (same location as your old init.c).
3. Rename `(missionName).init.c` to `init.c`
4. Edit the file and add your VIP / Admin IDs to the appropriate array. They are clearly marked with comments. 

You can find your player ID by looking through your console and server logs for entries like this:
	
	12:20:20 Player RandomGuy connected (id=Iju6RjrohthfN7ITmRaf8eerbS4hjSfyzGs1vhHvm8g=)
	
You want to cut and paste everything after `id=` and before `)`
	
like this: `Iju6RjrohthfN7ITmRaf8eerbS4hjSfyzGs1vhHvm8g=`
