# DayZSA Custom VIP and Admin Loadouts using init.c

Pro Tip: Fork this repository so you can edit and track your own changes (top right Fork icon)

Advanced users can simply use the merge files provided. 

Everyone else please use follow these instructions:

1. Rename your existing missions `init.c` to `backup_init.c` 
2. Download the correct `init.c` to your mission folder (same location as your old init.c).
3. Edit the file and add your VIP / Admin IDs to the appropriate array. They are clearly marked with comments. 

You can find your player ID by looking through your console and server logs for entries like this:
	
	12:20:20 Player RandomGuy connected (id=Iju6RjrohthfN7ITmRaf8eerbS4hjSfyzGs1vhHvm8g=)
	
You want to cut and paste everything after `id=` and before `)`
	
like this: `Iju6RjrohthfN7ITmRaf8eerbS4hjSfyzGs1vhHvm8g=`
